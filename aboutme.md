Things which make me happy, that I can spend hours doing:
* exploring the diversity of functional areas, thus,  fostering a higher degree of technical and functional versatility, while refining a sense of relationship.
* comparing, contrasting, and combining creative ideas to develop insights and alternative possibilities

My main areas of interests are technology, compliance, and art. I have experience in UI Design and Application Development, Application Support, Requirement management, Client Support and Problem Solving and Formal
Ontology, Conceptual Modeling, and Metamodeling as well.

Also, I'd like to share with you my interests in the use of free software and radio systems.

Moreover I am particularly interested in development of my public speaking skills at Toastmasters.

And last but not least I like psycho-philosophy, poetry, music, dance and felines :)
